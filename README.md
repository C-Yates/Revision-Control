# Revision-Control
Folder structuring and document revision control

This was a 1 week development of a tool used alongside the VBA standard library generation tool which is also on my GitHub. After the VBA macro generates hundreds of files of various types, they need to be stored in the relevant places. Due to various file extensions and locations being used there are a lot of loop iterations in this which slow down efficiency but works as intended.

All commits have been added to the repositry to see the development over the week but these were done prior to my Git account being made to the changes aren't well documented in the change log.
